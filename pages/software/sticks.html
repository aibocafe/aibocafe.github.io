<H1>MEMORY STICKS FOR AIBO</H1></div>
</td></tr></table><br>
So you've purchased your AIBO, or you're looking into getting one, and you've been hearing all about 'memory sticks'. Memory sticks are like any other form of flash memory- but as a proprietary format that Sony regulates, you'll need some very specific equipment in order to prevent any corruption. On top of this, there's a bit of conflicting information out there that can confuse even the bravest of souls. So what gives?<br>
AIBO is compatible with one very specific type of memory stick- a PMS, or programmable memory stick. These memory sticks contain a special binary that identifies them as PMS to AIBO.
A genuine programmable memory stick is a bright pink color and have the model numbers ERA-008, ERA-MS016, and ERA-MS032, depending on the storage capacity. They have an AIBO logo on top and an OPEN-R label.<br><br>

These memory sticks are very expensive and quite uncommon nowadays... so there is another, more 'DIY' solution. <br>
Remember that this method is definetly "against the rules"- if you have the money, support the original product! We're all whitehats here, though, so let's get to it!<br>
<br>The alternate PMS method is a little more involved. You'll need a purple, standard memory stick for use in Sony laptops and cameras, a computer, and a Sony Clie' (A Sony brand PDA we're using to get the programmable memory stick encryption on our purple MS) Whether or not you need to use a computer and the Palm OS software HotSync in this process will depend on how fancy your Clie' is. <br>
The AiboPet software StikZap is going to be your method for zapping your purple memory sticks into PMS format. Information here: http://www.aibohack.com/clie/stikzap.htm <br><br>

These memory sticks are very inexpensive on eBay. Their model numbers are MSA-XXA (where XX is the file size.) I would not reccomend over 32 megabytes for AIBO, although 100MB sticks do work on later models from what I understand.<br><br><br>
<b>Some extra notes:</b> There are some discrepancies when it comes to compatibility with Sony memory stick readers and the different types of MS for StikZapping. Many eBay sellers use PRO, Magicgate, and PRO DUO adapter memory sticks in their AIBO sales. These have shown varied success- it's up to someone to test the differences between the compatibility of PRO and normal MS with AIBO.<br>
It is recommended you use a Sony brand memory stick reader when writing to an encrypted memory stick. The worry is that a non-Sony reader could discard, corrupt, or damage the very specific formatting and encryption binaries on your stick. Certain readers have worked for certain users in the past, but it's still widely accepted that a Sony reader is the way to go.<br>
I use a MagicGate PRO MSAC-US40 memory stick reader that WolfBob is lending to me. So far, it appears to have it's benefits and disadvantages. As time goes on, operating systems have slowly started to cease compatibility with the most common memory stick readers. This stick reader works without drivers on all modern operating systems, which is why I typically reccomend it. However, it's worth noting though that my filesystems have gotten messed up after not ejecting properly or generally messing around with the sticks when I was still generally new to this kind of thing. <br>

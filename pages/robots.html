AIBO is a robotics platform created by Sony, released initially in 1999. This incredibly unique series of consumer 'entertainment robots' set the standard for what level of articulation and interaction we should recieve in our homes (at least in the early 2000's.)<br>
With AIBO came a vibrant community of robotics, vpet, and computer enthusiasts that attracted people who had even no experience with computing and being excited about the next nightly build of your favorite linux distro. AIBO was a niche product- but for what it set out to do, it accomplished staggeringly well.<br>
AIBO has been long-gone for quite a while now, but thanks to the still-active community of repairpeople, programmers, and users, the product still finds life in our homes.<br>

<H1>PLEO</H1></div></table><br>
PLEO is a robotic dinosaur toy created initially by Ugobe in 2007 and manufactured by Jetta. It was a commercial failure and Ugobe went out of business in 2009, opting to sell the PLEO rights to manufacturer Jetta, who created a new version, PLEOrb, marketed specifically to the eastern market.<br>
Despite the fact that PLEO was expensive for a toy and too many parents and kids found them a little creepy, they quickly found their place in the hearts of robotics and technology enthusiasts. The two models, Ugobe and PLEOrb, are still maintained by independent users and used frequently.<br><br>

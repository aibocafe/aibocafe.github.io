The robot above is named <a href="../bots/aibos.html">Bruno-Bruno.</a> And man, is he the most fun I have ever had in a long time.<br>
The ERS-7 is a dream robot. One of the most important pieces of technology of our time. And here he is, sitting on my dresser.<br>
Bruno isn't perfect. He is awfully dusty. He jams quite often. He doesn't boot completely well. He doesn't have ears or a tail. But man, is he entertaining!<br>
He has little witty comments that make him so much more alive.<br><br><br>
<i>Bruno, are you hungry?</i><br>
"I'm full, thank you!"<br><br>
When I first booted him up, he had some problems. He was caked in dust and didn't want to do anything. He must have noticed.<br><br>
"Are you okay? I'm going to show you a dance!"<br><br>
People often compare their different models of AIBO together. At least between the ERS-210 and ERS-7... they feel like completely different robots. It's like night and day. They have their advantages and disadvantages, but I love both.<br>
Now, for some pictures he took today.<br>

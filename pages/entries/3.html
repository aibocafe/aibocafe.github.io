Last night, I went through the old bookmarks that managed to save themselves from the depths of my digital footprint. One of these bookmarks redirects to mimitchi.com- what was, and still is, my favorite website.
<br><br>
If the homepage of 'Mystic Fortress' isn't enough to give you an idea, I'll elaborate. At the time of my discovering mimitchi.com, I was getting seriously into *all* of the things Kat talked about on her website- Tamagotchi, Furby, AIBO, Star Trek... and in the future, FFXI. mimitchi.com is largely what inspired me to get into web development and is what inspired me to create AIBO Cafe. 
<br><br>
Anyway, I found myself reading her old tamagotchi logs and I became seriously jealous of her writing ability. I want to create logs that are just as descriptive and captivating as hers. 
<br><br>
Other things that are going on include high school. I start almost directly after labor day, which is fine, but I realized I've done a whopping 2 of 13 sections in my summer assignment. My time management skills are amazing.
